# ${1:BoardGameGraph}
Generate complete game graphs for simple board games like Checkers, Reversi, Connect Four, etc.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn a new language, not to practice precise game theory.
In fact, I have not studied any game theory or existing game graphs and plan to compare my methods and results
with current practice at the conclusion of this project.
## Installation
The project is a Visual Studio 2015 project.  Pull the dev branch, remove BoardGameGraph.sln, and create a project from existing files.
Install MongoDB 3.2 or implememnt the IDatabase interface with a database of your choice.
## Usage
Use the application to analyze difficulty and fairness of board games.
## Contributing

2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request

## History
I spend way too much time playing simple board games like Checkers, Reversi, and Connect Four, with deplorable win/lose/draw stats.
I am unemployed at this writing and would like to spend some of my time learning a managed programming language.
